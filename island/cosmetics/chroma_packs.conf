# Colors will be displayed in the editor UI in the order they are declared
# in this config file, starting at the top and going down, row by row (i.e. the
# first three colors defined in this file will make up the first row of the 
# editor UI, then the next three would be the next row and so on).
#
# The order of the packs can be changed as well as the order of the colors within
# them. This config file has no concept of "shades", so you can just define them
# in whatever order you like.
#
# The grayscale color set is unlocked by default when you unlock your first chroma
# pack and will always be displayed after all chroma packs, regardless of where it
# is defined in this config.
